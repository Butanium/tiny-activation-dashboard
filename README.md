# Tiny Activation Dashboard
A tiny easily hackable implementation of a feature dashboard.
## Installation

```bash
pip install tiny-dashboard
```

## Overview

This repository provides minimal implementations of activations visualization with:
- An online feature dashboard, where you compute and display activations on some custom text
- An offline feature dashboard, which can display precomputed activation examples.

To get an overview of all the features you can check the [demo on colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Butanium/tiny-activation-dashboard/blob/main/demo.ipynb)!

## Motivation

There are some other good feature activations dashboard tools out there, but I found them very hard to hack on when I wanted to add support for Crosscoders. This implementation is not as complete as https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAEDashboard or even the simplier https://github.com/callummcdougall/sae_vis but in my honest non-biased-at-all opinion, this implementation seems easier to hack on?

If you're looking for a quick and easy to setup tool for feature analysis, this might be the one for you.

## Key Features

Both the offline and online dashboards include:

- Token-level activation highlighting
- Hover tooltips showing token details
- Responsive design
- Save HTML reports

### 1. Offline Feature Exploration

- Analyze pre-computed feature activations
- Visualize max activation examples for specific features
- Expandable text views
- Generate interactive HTML reports

You can either store the max activation examples in a database file, or in a python dictionary.

#### A. Using a python dictionary

```py
from tiny_dashboard.feature_centric_dashboards import OfflineFeatureCentricDashboard

# Create dashboard with pre-computed activations
max_activation_examples: dict[int, list[tuple[float, list[str], list[float]]]] = ...
# max_activation_examples is a dictionary where the keys are feature indices and the values are lists of tuples. Each tuple contains a float (max activation value), a list of strings (the text of the example), and a list of floats (the activation values for each token in the example).

dashboard = OfflineFeatureCentricDashboard(max_activation_examples, tokenizer)
dashboard.display()

# Export to HTML for sharing
feature_to_export = 0
dashboard.export_to_html("feature_analysis.html", feature_to_export)
```

#### B. Using a database file

For larger datasets, you can store your max activation examples in a `sqlite3` database. This allows you to avoid loading all the examples into memory.
The database should contain a table with:

- A primary key column of type INTEGER
- A column storing lists of examples as a JSON string, where each example is a tuple containing:
  - max_activation_value (`float`): The highest activation value
  - tokens (`list[str]`): The sequence of tokens
  - activation_values (`list[float]`): The activation value for each token

```py
dashboard = OfflineFeatureCentricDashboard.from_db("path/to/db.db", tokenizer, column_name="column_name_of_examples")
dashboard.display()
```

Check [demo.ipynb](demo.ipynb) for an example on how to build such a database from a python dictionary.

### 2. Online Feature Exploration

The online dashboard allows you to analyze the activations of a model in real-time. This is useful for quickly exploring the activations of a model on your custom prompts.

The online dashboard supports `chat_template` formatting: just include `<eot>` in your input text to separate your chat turns. E.g:

```
What is the capital of France?<eot>The capital of France is Paris.<eot>Good bing
```

will be interpreted as:

```json
[
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "The capital of France is Paris."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Good bing"}
]
```

and formated using the tokenizer's chat template.

Two approaches to build your real-time feature analysis dashboard:

#### A. Class-based Method

Create a class that implements the `AbstractOnlineFeatureCentricDashboard` class and implements the `get_feature_activation` function. This function should take a string and a tuple of feature indices and return a tensor of activation values of shape (seq_len, num_features) containing the activations of the specified features for the input text.

```py
from tiny_dashboard.feature_centric_dashboards import AbstractOnlineFeatureCentricDashboard
class DummyOnlineFeatureCentricDashboard(AbstractOnlineFeatureCentricDashboard):
    def get_feature_activation(self, text: str, feature_indices: tuple[int, ...]) -> th.Tensor:
        # Custom activation computation logic
        tok_len = len(self.tokenizer.encode(text))
        activations = th.randn((tok_len, len(feature_indices))).exp()
        return activations
    
    # Optional: override generate_model_response to change the model's response generation

online_dashboards = DummyOnlineFeatureCentricDashboard(tokenizer)
online_dashboards.display()
```

#### B. Function-based Method

If you hate classes for some reason, you can also use the function-based method:

```py
from tiny_dashboard.feature_centric_dashboards import OnlineFeatureCentricDashboard
def get_feature_activation(text, feature_indices):
    return th.randn((len(tokenizer.encode(text)), len(feature_indices))).exp()

online_dashboards = OnlineFeatureCentricDashboard(
    get_feature_activation, 
    tokenizer,
    generate_model_response = None,  # Optional: override the model's response generation function
    model = None,  # Optional: pass in a model to use the model's response generation function
    call_with_self = False,  # Whether to call the functions with self as the first argument, defaults to Falses
)
online_dashboards.display()
```

### Specialized Implementations

The package includes several specialized dashboard implementations in `dashboard_implementations.py`:

#### CrosscoderOnlineFeatureDashboard

For analyzing features using a crosscoder model that combines base and instruct model activations:

```python
from tiny_dashboard.dashboard_implementations import CrosscoderOnlineFeatureDashboard

base_model, instruct_model, crosscoder = ...
collect_layer = 12

dashboard = CrosscoderOnlineFeatureDashboard(
    base_model=base_model,
    instruct_model=instruct_model,
    crosscoder=crosscoder,
    collect_layer=collect_layer,
    crosscoder_device="cuda"  # optional, use it if the crosscoder is on a different device than the base and instruct models
)
dashboard.display()
```

Additional specialized implementations can be found in the `dashboard_implementations.py` file. Feel free to contribute new implementations!
